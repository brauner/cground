# Setting up a container without fsid mappings.

# The current status quo before the fsid mappings patchset is that only id
# mappings are setup.
# The fsid mappings are simpli identical to the id mappings.
# This is still the case whenever no fsid mappings are setup.
# Let's show this:

lxc launch images:fedora/31 fed1
lxc exec fed1 bash
cat /proc/self/uid_map
cat /proc/self/gid_map
cat /proc/self/fsuid_map
cat /proc/self/fsgid_map

exit

ls -al /var/lib/lxd/storage-pools

# So container runtimes don't need to care about fsid mappings.
