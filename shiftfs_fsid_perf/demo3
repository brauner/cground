# We want to share dedicated storage with all three containers.
# This is often used when e.g. sharing large datasets amongs containers
# that perform calculations and write back results to the shared storage.

# For extra security we want all containers to have different id mappings.
# To this end we set the security.idmap.isolated property.

lxc profile set default security.idmap.isolated true

# Now we launch tree containers. All of them will have isolated id mappings:

lxc launch images:ubuntu/focal f1
lxc launch images:fedora/31 fed1
lxc launch images:opensuse/tumbleweed o1

# Let's verify that they all have the same id mapping:

lxc shell f1
lxc exec f1 -- cat /proc/self/{uid,gid}_map
lxc exec fed1 -- cat /proc/self/{uid,gid}_map
lxc exec o1 -- cat /proc/self/{uid,gid}_map

# But they should all have the same fsid map

lxc exec f1 -- cat /proc/self/fs{uid,gid}_map
lxc exec fed1 -- cat /proc/self/fs{uid,gid}_map
lxc exec o1 -- cat /proc/self/fs{uid,gid}_map

# Now we want to share a git repository between all three containers.
ls -al /srv/qemu/
lxc profile device add f1 shared-storage disk source=/srv/qemu path=/opt/qemu

# The fsid mappings will take care that the repository has correct permissions
# in all three containers even though they all have isolated id mappings.
lxc shell f1
ls -al /opt/qemu

lxc shell fed1
ls -al /opt/qemu

lxc shell o1
ls -al /opt/qemu

# It's also writable for all three containers:
lxc exec f1 -- touch /opt/qemu/f1-file
lxc exec fed1 -- touch /opt/qemu/fed1-file
lxc exec o1 -- touch /opt/qemu/o1-file

# And the fsid mappings will take care that all those files have the expected
# permissions on the host:
ls -al /srv/qemu/{f1,fed1,o1}-file
